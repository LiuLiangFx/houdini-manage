1. Install Python 2.7 or 3.3+ from [Python.org](https://python.org/)

2. Make sure you have Pip installed. If you don't, download
   [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) and run:

        > python C:\Users\niklas\Downloads\get-pip.py     # (Windows)
        $ python /Users/niklas/Downloads/get-pip.py       # (macOS)

4. Install **Houdini-manage** by running

        $ pip install git+https://github.com/NiklasRosenstein/houdini-manage.git

5. Check if it worked

        $ houdini-manage --version
        0.0.1

> **macOS**: It is very likely that you need to use `sudo <command>`.  
> **Windows**: Depending on where you chose to install Python, you might need
> an Administrator console on Windows.
